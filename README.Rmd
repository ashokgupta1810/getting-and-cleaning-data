# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

1. Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
2. Load the activity and feature info
3. Loads both the training and test datasets
4. Merge all datasets into one
5. Set descriptive column names
6. Filtering mean and sd fields
7. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file `secTidySet.txt`.
